**Update (20 Mar 2017): That something is C. I've been using C and bash scripting for the last year and a half, and it does this all.**

1. Single installer, install everything by imports
1. Cross-platform
1. Can call C and Fortran out of the box
1. Will run legacy code without having to write more legacy code glue
1. Lets me be as efficient as I want to be without extra libraries and syntax
1. Simple syntax

and the most important thing of all:

1. Will run on any hardware that I throw at it, without having to do much to my code (builtin parallelism)

I am looking for a single solution that will handle these things. MATLAB almost
has it, but they are holding on too tightly to their monolithic nature as the
be-all, end-all of scientific computing.  They need to be humble enough, when
appropriate, to become just a tool in bigger toolchains.
