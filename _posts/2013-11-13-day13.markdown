* Purchased a few parts at Surplus Gizmos. Awesome store!
* Left undecided whether or not to build easy, replaceable low-pass
  filters for when sample rates change. Probably not for version sputnik.
* Did a lot of mental sketching while working on class project. Most of the
  design work for this project is happening throughout the day. It unusual
  for there to be a new sketch or schematic at the end of the day even
  though I may have done a re-design in my head.
