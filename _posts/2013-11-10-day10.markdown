* Sabbath day: Went to church because I want to be more like Jesus Christ,
  especially how He was nice to people and didn't care about wealth and
  fame and recognition.  AND He said "No" to greed.  I hate greed because
  it makes nice people really mean and cold, and we all can't get good things
  accomplished when its around.
