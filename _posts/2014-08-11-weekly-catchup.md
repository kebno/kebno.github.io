## Thing 1

I see a lot of eucalyptus trees now. I've moved from sunny Portland, to sunny
San Diego, CA.

## Thing 2

Xiph.Org is the group behind the FLAC, Ogg Vorbis, and Theora multimedia
formats.  Recently they released two videos about the basics of digital media
(from a signal processing point of view).  I **highly** recommend watching
both.

## Thing 3

Over at windytan's blog,
[absorptions](http://www.windytan.com/2013/02/voice-over-laser.html), is an
article about basic audio transmission with a laser. She used single-side-band
(SSB), frequency-modulated audio for transmission, and demodulated the received
signal with hardware.  I'm not too familiar with frequencey modulation, and
wanted to hear the modulated signal (at 6kHz), but she didn't provide audio, nor
the code for demodulating the same audio file.

Starting from [her script](https://gist.github.com/windytan/5021143), I added
modulation and demodualtion of a different file using the same method.  I put
the code and an audio file up on Github in my one-off project collection
repository [`prac`](https://github.com/kebno/prac/tree/master/007) (as in
"practice").
