title: Melville Cruise Day 00
---

Today begins a 10 day experiment on the R/V Melville  to measure ambient noise
in the 3-6 kHz range in the deep ocean.  William Hodgkiss is the PI, and his
group has built a rather nice hydrophone array designed for that frequency
band.


I am part of the trip because I am a graduate student in the Applied Ocean
Sciences curricular group and a member of the [Marine Physical
Laboratory](http://mpl.ucsd.edu) at University of California at San Diego. My
adviser is William Kupermann.

#### Today's Events
  * Flew to San Jose, then to Portland, OR.
  * Took a shuttle from Portland to Newport, OR.
  * Met the R/V Melville at the dock for Oregon State University's R/V Oceanus.
