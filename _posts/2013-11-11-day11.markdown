* Veterans Day.  Thought about how silly war has become in America.
* We don't even know what war is anymore, we go to war with lots of
  things like "drugs", "crime", "terror", "obesity", "poverty". The last
  time I checked, none of those things wanted to invade our country and
  kill everyone and take away freedom.
* Installed Kicad in Linux. apt-get install FTW!
