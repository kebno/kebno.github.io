* Thought a lot about the cabling/connector issue. The mic modules I will use
  have regular header pins on them.  So, I will make a mounting board on single
  sided PCB. It will have female headers at several locations to accamodate
  multiple spacings and number of sensors depending on the design frequency and
  will allow for a single power line to all sensors.  I find this idea to be
  rather brilliant.  This will also make it easy to attach through-hole
  connectors of any type.  AND it will be easy to attach the entire thing to
  other things for mounting purposes. Expect a gerber layout this week.
* Told my wife about this great idea and realized that doing multiple
  frequencies will be tricky because more sensors means more unique signal
  lines that would have to cross paths in order to support say 3 sensor and
  also 8 sensor configurations.  Just had the idea that jumpers could solve
  this problem. (Rubber ducky programming works! Thanks Theo.)
