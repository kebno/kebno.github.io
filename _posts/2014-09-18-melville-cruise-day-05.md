#### Recent Events
  * Coded up the waveguide invariant processing from "Invariant-based
    Rangle-localization from a Frequency-time Spectrogram," by Rakotonarivo &
    Kuperman.  
  * I re-learned the concept of phase speed. Phase speed is the speed of a wave
    front of constant phase relative to some direction (in this case
    horizontal). Dr.  Kuperman gave a great example.  Imagine being at the beach
    near Scripps.  You and a friend stand near the water and wait for a wave to
    come up.  You agree to raise your hands when the top of the wave reaches
    your feet.  If the wavefront reaches both of you at the same time, your arms
    would go up at the same time and it is as if that wavefront of constant
    phase traveled between the two of you at infinite speed.  If the wave were
    traveling parallel to shore, it would reach one and then the other of you at
    the usual speed of waves in water. Phase speed is always measured relative
    to some direction at some point or points.  It can vary from the propagation
    speed of the medium to infinite.
  * Visited the ship library in an attempt to do some writing. After writing for
    a few minutes, I got up and found Robert Jordan novels and started to read
    the first Wheel of Time book.  I like it, and I owe it to Chris and Amy
    for recommending it so heartily last week.
