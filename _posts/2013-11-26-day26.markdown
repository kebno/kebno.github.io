* The first time I heard about NaNoWriMo, I fell in love with the idea. I even tried it
  for a few days that year, but I gave up because I am too busy in November to write that much.
* I started NaBeBuiMo because I knew deep down that I wouldn't have time to complete version 0 of
  the beamformer before December. I tried.  
* NaNoWriMo would be much more of a social force if they didn't do it in during the month of
  stress for college students.
* This has been an awesome adventure. I'm proud of the work that I've done, and I think I've
  worked out most of the details. All that is left is the building and testing (at least for version 0).
* I will focus now on completing a graduate school application before the end of the week.
* Then, I will make a one page flyer about what I have done for NaBeBuiMo to take with me to a conference
  next week.
* NaBeBuiMo is over. Maybe I will do it again next year, but during a different month.
